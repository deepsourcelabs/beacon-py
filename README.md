**NOTE: `beacon-py` is currently in a pre-release phase, so we do not recommend using it at the moment.**

Beacon runs inside your Python applications and collects metrics around how the code behaves in runtime &mdash; usage of modules, volume of exceptions, to name a few. Python versions 2.7 & 3.4-3.7 are officially supported.

## Installation

To install beacon-py, use pipenv (or pip):

```bash
$ pipenv install beacon
```
